 This code has ability to create NFTs. I created a array of NFTs, additionally there are three function :
 1)mintNFT(): to create a object that holds the metadata of the NFTs.
 2)listNFTs(): to list all the metadata of the NFTs
 3) getTotal(): to get the total number of NFTs created.
 after that simply call all the function.
